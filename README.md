# 👋 Hey there! I'm Evan Marshall

**Full Stack Software Engineer** | **8+ Years Experience** | **User-First Design Advocate**

I'm a full stack software engineer with 8+ years of experience and a background in retail sales leadership. I blend a user-first mindset with a strong eye for design to build digital experiences that are as functional as they are engaging.

I'm self-taught through professional projects, bootcamps, and online courses—a path that's made me a lifelong learner and pragmatic problem-solver. I've delivered custom solutions for local businesses and spent nearly 4 years as the sole developer on the Hudson's Bay content engineering team, maintaining a high-traffic e-commerce platform used by millions daily.

Whether leading a project or collaborating across teams, I bring clarity, creativity, and clean code to the table. I thrive on solving complex problems, writing maintainable code, and making tech approachable for everyone involved.
